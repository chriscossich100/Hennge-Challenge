# IMPROVEMENTS FOR MOCKUP UI


THIS DOCUMENT WILL TALK ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE DONE ON THE UI.

# New Features!

   1.   A search Feature that allows us to search mail by name
   2.   Include at least a preview of the actual email message in the UI. 
   3.   Mark viewed emails as 'read'.


## Sender Search feature
  1. Being able to search for a specific mail by a user can be helpful as a lot of times people look for emails sent by a specific sender
  2. Having the ability to search by sender is key as at times, it can be hard to recollect when an email was sent

## Preview Actual Content of Email
  1. In most email services, the list of emails usually contain a preview of the actual email not just the details of the email
  2. Being able to read at least a small preview of the message before opening it, can make it convinient. In this case, our UI markup didnt have the task of adding a preview. However, adding this can improve the overall convinience and look of the UI markup

## Mark as read
  1. Once an email has been read it would be nice to know that it has been read.
  2. Showing 'read' emails prevents confusion and allows lets the user know that the email has been read.
