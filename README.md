# Hennge Challenge Code:

This is a simple UI Design test that finds the emails of a specified date. In this program, once the email(s) have been found, the user can sort them by date.

_if you want to give it a try, since the emails are hard-coded, the range for the dates are: 12/29/2019 - 1/3/2020_

This was coded using vanilla JS to show overall javascript skills.
